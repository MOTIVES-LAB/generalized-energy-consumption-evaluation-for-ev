# Data and Code for Generalized Energy Consumption Evaluation for BEVs  

## Overview  
**Standard energy consumption testing** is the only publicly available quantifiable measure of battery electric vehicle (BEV) energy consumption, and it plays a crucial role in promoting transparency and accountability in the electrified automotive industry. However, significant discrepancies between standard testing and real-world driving conditions have hindered accurate energy and environmental assessments of BEVs, affecting their broader adoption.  
To address this issue, we propose a data-driven evaluation method to better characterize BEV energy consumption. We introduce a novel energy consumption metric, the **Generalized Energy Consumption Rates (GECRs)**, which decouples the impact of different driving profiles, making it applicable to various driving conditions. This repository contains the data and source code designed to validate the feasibility of GECRs.  
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of the proposed approach in enhancing public awareness of BEV energy consumption through standard testing. Additionally, GECRs provide a reliable **fundamental model** for understanding and assessing BEV energy consumption performance in real-world scenarios.
